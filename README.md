Project Landing Page for TOP

A project to create a landing page for The Odin Project course.
This tested my knowledge of basic HTML and CSS, as well as my project management skills.

For the subject of this page I took one of my other hobbies which is photography and especially one of the goals I still have at becoming a better night photographer.
